## Glossary

- **A1C**: A1C is a blood protein, measured from plasma, representing the average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. It is strongly associated with diabetes and used to diagnose and monitor Type 2 Diabetes.
- **Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)**: ALP is an enzyme measured from blood serum, primarily representing liver and bone health. It is most strongly associated with liver disease and bone disorders, including liver damage and bile duct blockages.
- **ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase)**: ALT is a liver enzyme measured from blood serum, reflective of liver cell damage. It is most strongly linked to liver diseases, including hepatitis and fatty liver disease.
- **AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase)**: AST is an enzyme measured from blood serum, indicating damage to the liver, heart, or muscles. It is strongly associated with liver and heart diseases, particularly alcohol-related liver disease.
- **AST-ALT Ratio**: This ratio compares AST and ALT enzyme levels from blood serum and is a diagnostic marker. A high ratio is strongly associated with alcohol-induced liver damage or cirrhosis.
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: BMI is a calculated value from weight and height, representing body fat levels. It is associated with obesity and related conditions like Type 2 Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.
- **C-Reactive Protein (CRP)**: CRP is a protein measured from blood plasma, representing systemic inflammation. It is strongly associated with inflammatory diseases, especially cardiovascular disease and infection.
- **Creatinine**: Creatinine is a waste product measured from blood or urine, representing kidney function. Elevated levels are strongly associated with kidney diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- **Cystatin C**: Cystatin C is a protein measured from blood serum that reflects kidney filtration. It is strongly associated with kidney function and is a more sensitive marker than creatinine for detecting kidney impairment.
- **Eosinophil Count**: Eosinophils are white blood cells measured from blood, representing immune response to allergens and infections. High levels are associated with allergic diseases, asthma, and parasitic infections.
- **Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT)**: GGT is an enzyme measured from blood serum, reflecting liver and bile duct health. It is strongly associated with liver disease, particularly alcohol-related liver injury.
- **Glucose**: Glucose is a sugar measured from blood, indicating the bodyâ€™s sugar levels. It is strongly associated with diabetes and metabolic disorders, particularly Type 2 Diabetes.
- **Grip Strength**: Grip strength is a functional measure of muscular strength, often used as a proxy for overall health. Low grip strength is strongly associated with frailty and mortality risk, especially in older adults.
- **HDL Cholesterol**: HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) is a lipoprotein measured from blood serum, representing cholesterol transport. It is strongly associated with cardiovascular health, with higher levels linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.
- **Hemoglobin**: Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells, measured from blood, representing oxygen-carrying capacity. It is associated with anemia and other blood disorders.
- **IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor 1)**: IGF-1 is a hormone measured from blood serum, reflecting growth and anabolic processes. Low levels are associated with aging and conditions like growth hormone deficiency.
- **LDL Cholesterol**: LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) is a lipoprotein measured from blood serum, associated with cholesterol transport. High levels are strongly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
- **LDL-ApoB Ratio (LAR)**: This ratio compares LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, both measured from blood, reflecting the risk of atherosclerosis. It is strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases.
- **Lipoprotein (a)**: Lipoprotein (a) is a cholesterol particle measured from blood serum, representing cardiovascular risk. High levels are strongly linked to atherosclerosis and heart disease.
- **Lymphocyte Count**: Lymphocytes are white blood cells measured from blood, representing immune function. Abnormal levels are associated with infections, immune disorders, and certain cancers.
- **Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)**: MCV is a measure of the average size of red blood cells, derived from blood tests. It is strongly associated with anemia types, especially macrocytic and microcytic anemia.
- **Monocyte Count**: Monocytes are a type of white blood cell measured from blood, representing immune response. Elevated levels are associated with chronic infections and inflammatory conditions.
- **Neutrophil Count**: Neutrophils are white blood cells measured from blood, indicating infection or inflammation. Elevated levels are strongly associated with bacterial infections.
- **Pulse Rate**: Pulse rate is a measure of heartbeats per minute, often taken from arteries. It is associated with cardiovascular fitness and overall heart health, with abnormal rates linked to heart disease.
- **Red Blood Cell Count (RBC)**: RBC count is measured from blood, representing the number of red blood cells. Low levels are associated with anemia, while high levels can indicate polycythemia or dehydration.
- **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW)**: RDW measures the variation in red blood cell size, derived from blood tests. It is associated with anemia and cardiovascular disease.
- **SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin)**: SHBG is a protein measured from blood serum, which binds sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen. Abnormal levels are associated with hormonal imbalances and metabolic conditions.
- **Smoke Pack Years**: This measure estimates smoking exposure over time (packs of cigarettes per day multiplied by years smoked). It is strongly associated with lung diseases, including Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and lung cancer.
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**: Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in arteries during heartbeats, measured from blood pressure tests. High levels are strongly associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease.
- **Testosterone**: Testosterone is a hormone measured from blood serum, representing reproductive and metabolic function. Low levels are associated with hypogonadism and age-related health decline.
- **Triglycerides**: Triglycerides are fats measured from blood serum, representing lipid metabolism. High levels are strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.
- **Urate**: Urate (uric acid) is a waste product measured from blood or urine, representing purine metabolism. High levels are associated with gout and kidney stones.
- **Urea**: Urea is a waste product measured from blood or urine, indicating kidney function. Elevated levels are strongly associated with kidney dysfunction and dehydration.
- **Vitamin D**: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin measured from blood, representing bone and immune health. Deficiency is strongly associated with osteoporosis and weakened immune function.
- **White Blood Cell (WBC) Count**: WBC count is measured from blood, representing immune system activity. Abnormal levels are associated with infections, immune disorders, and leukemias.

Smoke_Pack_Yrs	Smoking	Smoke Pack Years is a measure of smoking exposure calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette packs smoked per day by the number of years the person has smoked. It's a common way to assess the long-term impact of smoking on health, particularly in studies related to lung disease.
albumin	Albumin	Albumin is a protein produced by the liver that plays an important role in maintaining blood volume and transporting various substances, including hormones, vitamins, and medications. Monitoring albumin levels helps diagnose and manage conditions related to the liver, kidneys, and nutritional status. Low albumin levels can indicate liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, as the liver is responsible for producing this protein. Abnormal albumin levels can also be a sign of kidney disease, malnutrition, or inflammation, as the body’s ability to produce or retain albumin is affected by these conditions.
alp	ALP	Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in many parts of your body. Monitoring this biomarker helps diagnose diseases of the liver or bones and measure how well your liver is working. Each part of your body produces a different type of ALP. Most ALP is found in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. Abnormal levels of ALP in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease.
alt	ALT	Alanine Transaminase (ALT) is an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood. When liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease. Some types of liver disease cause high ALT levels before you have symptoms of the disease. Thus, ALT blood tests may help diagnose certain liver diseases early.
ast	AST	Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme found mostly in the liver, but it is also found in muscles and other organs in your body. When cells containing AST are damaged, they release the AST into your blood. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.
ast_alt_ratio	AST/ALT Ratio	AST-ALT Ratio is a simple comparison of two liver enzymes, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), measured in the blood to help assess liver health. In healthy livers, ALT levels are generally higher than AST because ALT is more specific to the liver. When liver damage occurs, both AST and ALT can rise, but the ratio between them can hint at the type or severity of liver issues. For example, an AST level that’s much higher than ALT (usually a ratio over two) sometimes indicates alcoholic liver disease. A ratio closer to one or below may suggest other liver conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
bmi	BMI	Body Mass Index (BMI) is quick calculation using a person’s height and weight to estimate if they are within a healthy weight range. It doesn’t directly measure body fat but gives an idea of whether someone might be underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.
creatinine	Creatinine	Creatinine is a normal waste product in your body. It's made when you use your muscles and some of the muscle tissue breaks down. Normally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine. If there is a problem with your kidneys, creatinine can build up in your blood and less may be released in urine. If blood and/or urine creatinine levels are not normal, it may be a sign of kidney disease.
crp	CRP/hsCRP	C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein your liver makes. Normally, you have low levels of CRP in your blood. Your liver releases more CRP into your bloodstream if you have inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP may mean you have a serious health condition causing inflammation. Inflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues and helping them heal from an injury, infection, or other disease. If inflammation lasts too long, it can damage healthy tissues. This is called chronic (long-term) inflammation. Chronic infections, certain autoimmune disorders, and other diseases can cause harmful chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation also can happen if your tissues are repeatedly injured or irritated, for example from smoking or chemicals in the environment.
cystatin_c	Cystatin C	Cystatin C is protein found in the blood that helps measure kidney function. It’s produced at a steady rate by most cells in the body and then filtered out by the kidneys. By measuring how much cystatin C is in the blood, clinicians can estimate how well the kidneys are working. When kidney function is good, cystatin C levels are low because the kidneys filter it out efficiently. High levels can suggest the kidneys aren’t filtering well, which may indicate kidney disease. Cystatin C may be especially useful because it’s less affected by factors like muscle mass, potentially making it a more accurate measure of kidney health than other tests, like creatinine.
eosinophils	Eosinophil Count	Eosinophil Count is a type of white blood cell helping the body fight off infections and react to allergens. Eosinophils are part of the immune system and usually make up a small percentage of the total white blood cells. A higher-than-normal eosinophil count can indicate an allergic reaction, asthma, or a parasitic infection. It also can signal certain inflammatory conditions or autoimmune diseases. A low count is usually normal and not a cause for concern. By checking eosinophil levels, clinicians gain insight into immune activity and better understand symptoms related to allergies or inflammation.
ggt	GGT	Gamma-glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found throughout your body, but it is mainly found in your liver. Enzymes are proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body. Thousands of enzymes play an important role in all of your body functions. If your liver or bile duct is damaged, GGT may leak into your bloodstream. High levels of GGT in your blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes carrying bile in and out of the liver. Bile is an important fluid for digestion made by the liver. While GGT can’t diagnose the specific cause of liver disease, levels that are out of range can indicate your liver is being damaged.
glucose	Glucose	Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It originates from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or cannot use insulin as well as it should, or both. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems and diabetes complications.
grip_strength	Grip Strength	Grip Strength is a simple measure of how much force you generate when you squeeze with your hand. It’s tested by squeezing a device called a dynamometer, which records the strength of your grip. This measurement isn’t just about hand strength; it’s also a quick indicator of overall muscle strength and health. Studies show lower grip strength often is linked to a higher risk of certain health issues, like heart disease or mobility problems, especially in older adults. Tracking grip strength helps clinicians assess muscle health, recovery progress, or the risk of future health conditions.
hdl	HDL	HDL Cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is often called the "good" cholesterol because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream. HDL transports excess cholesterol (a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood) from the arteries back to the liver, where it is processed and eliminated from the body, reducing the risk of cholesterol buildup which can lead to heart disease or stroke. The ideal HDL levels vary by age and gender.
hemoglobin	Hemoglobin	Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. Your hemoglobin levels provide information about the health of your red blood cells. If your hemoglobin levels are abnormal, it may be a sign that you have a blood disorder, often referred to as anemia.
hemoglobin_a1c	HbA1C	Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) reflects your average blood sugar (glucose) level over the past two to three months. Glucose is a type of sugar in your blood that comes from the foods you eat. Your cells use glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin balances glucose in your blood and cells. Glucose in your blood sticks to hemoglobin, a protein in your red blood cells. As your blood glucose levels increase, more of your hemoglobin will be coated with glucose. An A1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells reflecting glucose-coated hemoglobin. High A1C levels are a sign of high blood glucose from diabetes.
igf1	IGF1	IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) is a hormone, a chemical messenger in your bloodstream controlling the actions of certain cells or organs. IGF-1 manages the effects of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Together, IGF-1 and GH promote normal growth of bones and tissues. GH levels in the blood change throughout the day, depending on your diet and activity levels, while IGF-1 levels are more stable. A reliable way to track GH in your body is by measuring the level of IGF-1 in the blood. Levels of IGF-1 and GH change throughout your life. They are normally low when you are a child, increase until they peak during puberty, then decrease once you are an adult. Besides growth, GH also helps control your metabolism, which is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Some conditions, such as pituitary tumors, can cause your body to make too much or too little GH.
lar	LDL/ApoB Ratio	LDL-ApoB Ratio (LAR) compares levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) with Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), the main protein in LDL particles. This ratio provides additional information on cardiovascular risk by assessing both the cholesterol content and the number of LDL particles, as each ApoB represents an LDL particle. A lower LAR may indicate smaller, denser LDL particles, which are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
ldl	LDL	LDL Cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein), or "bad" cholesterol, is one of two types of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood and every cell of your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Too much LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. High LDL levels cause the buildup of a sticky substance called plaque in your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. Over time, plaque narrows your arteries or fully blocks them. When this happens, parts of your body may not get enough blood. If the blood flow to your heart is blocked, it can cause a heart attack. If the blood flow to your brain is blocked, it can cause a stroke. If the blood flow to your arms or legs is blocked, it can cause peripheral artery disease.
lpa	Lipoprotein a	Lipoprotein (a) is a type of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol. Lipoproteins are particles made of protein and fats (lipids). They carry cholesterol through your bloodstream to your cells. These lipoproteins carry cholesterol to the cells in your arteries. If you have high levels of LDL particles, cholesterol can build up in your arteries and form blockages called plaques. This condition is known as atherosclerosis or "hardening of the arteries." It can lead many serious medical conditions including coronary artery disease (narrow or blocked arteries in your heart), heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in your legs or arms), or other blood vessel diseases. Lipoprotein (a) particles are stickier than other types of LDL particles, so they may be more likely to cause blockages and blood clots in your arteries. As a result, high levels of lipoprotein (a) may mean you have a very high risk for heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions related to blockages and blood clots in your arteries. A lipoprotein (a) blood test gives you a more accurate understanding of your risk than a routine cholesterol tests only measuring your total LDL cholesterol level. This is because a routine cholesterol test may show your LDL cholesterol level is "healthy," but if a large percentage of your LDL cholesterol is carried by lipoprotein (a) particles, your risk for heart disease and stroke could still be high.
lymphocyte_percentage	Lymphocyte %	The lymphocyte percent test, part of a Complete Blood Count (CBC), measures the proportion of lymphocytes among white blood cells, providing insight into immune system health. High lymphocyte percentages can indicate viral infections, chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, or certain cancers, while low percentages may suggest acute infections, immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, or bone marrow disorders. This test helps diagnose and monitor conditions related to immune function and inflammation.
lymphocytes	Lymphocyte Count	Lymphocyte Count is part of a complete blood count (CBC) and measures lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell important for immune response. It can be elevated by infections or immune conditions and lowered by certain diseases or treatments. A CBC is a group of blood tests measuring the number and size of the different cells in your blood.
mcv	MCV	Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) is part of a complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a common blood test measuring many parts of your blood, including red blood cells. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and stay healthy. If your red blood cells are too small or too large, it could be a sign of a blood disorder such as anemia, a lack of certain vitamins, or other medical conditions.
monocytes	Monocyte Count	Monocyte Count is part of a complete blood count (CBC) and measures type of white blood cell that helps fight infection. Abnormal monocyte counts can be seen in infections, autoimmune diseases, or bone marrow disorders. A CBC is a group of blood tests measuring the number and size of the different cells in your blood.
neutrophils	Neutrophil Count	Neutrophil Count is part of a complete blood count (CBC) and measures a type of white blood cell that helps fight infection. Neutrophil count is part of a CBC and can be elevated in bacterial infections or reduced in conditions affecting bone marrow. A CBC is a group of blood tests measuring the number and size of the different cells in your blood.
rbc	RBC	Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) measures the number of red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, in your blood. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your large bones. They contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. An RBC count higher or lower than normal is often the first sign of an illness.
rdw	RDW	Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is a measurement of how much the volume and size of your red blood cells (erythrocytes) vary. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside your large bones). They contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. Normally, your red blood cells are about the same size. Differences in the size of your red blood cells may affect how well they can deliver oxygen through your body. An RDW test uses a special graph called a histogram. If your red blood cells are about the same size, they will be close together on the histogram, and the RDW will be low. A high RDW means the size of your red blood cells varies more than it should. The sizes will be more spread out on the histogram. This may be a sign of a medical condition.
resting_heartrate	Pulse Rate	Pulse Rate (or resting heart rate) measures the number of times your heart beats per minute at rest. It provides information on heart health and can vary with activity, stress, and health conditions. Resting heart rate gives insights into cardiovascular fitness and overall health, with lower rates often indicating better fitness and higher rates suggesting potential stress, dehydration, or heart conditions. Sudden changes also may signal early health issues like infection or thyroid changes.
shbg	SHBG	SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) is a protein made mostly in your liver. It binds (attaches) to sex hormones in your blood. SHBG helps control the amount of sex hormones that are actively working in your body. When the SHBG protein binds to sex hormones, your tissues can't use those hormones. Your tissues can only use sex hormones that are "free," which means they aren't attached to proteins, such as SHBG. An SHBG test is usually done if you have signs and/or symptoms of having too much or too little of the sex hormone testosterone. Testosterone is known as a "male" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. In adult males, testosterone controls sex drive, maintains muscle mass, and helps make sperm. In adult females, testosterone is important for healthy organs and the growth of bones and muscles. Measuring SHBG levels provides information about how much of your testosterone is active in the tissues of your body.
systolic_blood_pressure	Systolic Blood Pressure	Systolic Blood Pressure is the top number in a blood pressure reading. It indicates the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). A blood pressure measurement is a test measuring the force (pressure) in your arteries as your heart pumps. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
testosterone	Testosterone	Testosterone is known as a "male" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. Testosterone is made by the testicles (or testes), the part of the male reproductive system that makes sperm; the ovaries, the part of the female reproductive system that makes eggs; the adrenal glands, organs on top of each kidney that make several hormones. During male puberty, testosterone causes body hair, muscle growth, and a deepening voice. In adult life, it controls sex drive, maintains muscle mass, and helps make sperm. In females, testosterone is important for the growth of bones and muscles, and healthy organs. There are different forms of testosterone in your blood that may be measured to help diagnose certain health problems. Most of your testosterone is attached to proteins. The proteins prevent your tissues from using the testosterone right away, which helps control the amount of "active" testosterone in your body. Testosterone not attached to proteins is called free testosterone. Free testosterone acts on your tissues.
triglycerides	Triglycerides	Triglycerides is the amount of a fat in your blood called triglycerides. High triglycerides may increase your risk for a heart attack or stroke. Your body uses triglycerides for energy. If you eat more calories than you need, your body turns the extra calories into triglycerides and stores them in your fat cells to use later. When your body needs energy, your cells release triglycerides into your bloodstream to provide fuel for your muscles to work. If you eat more calories than you burn off, especially calories from carbohydrates, including sugary foods, and fats, you may have high triglyceride levels in your blood. A high blood triglyceride level usually doesn't cause any acute symptoms, but over time, may affect your arteries and pancreas and increase your risk of heart disease and pancreatitis.
urate	Urate	Urate (also known as Uric Acid) is a normal waste product your body makes when it breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines come from your cells when they die. Purines also are found in many foods and beverages. Most uric acid dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine. If uric acid builds up in your blood, it can form needle-shaped crystals in and around your joints. This condition is called gout. Gout is a type of arthritis causing painful swelling in your joints. High uric acid levels also can cause kidney stones, or kidney failure. However, not everyone with high levels of uric acid will have these problems.
urea	Urea	Urea is a waste product created when the liver breaks down proteins, and it is filtered by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Urea levels help indicate kidney and liver function, and abnormal results may signal health concerns in these areas.
vitamin_d	Vitamin D	Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones and teeth, and for your body to work well. It also helps keep your muscles, nerves, and immune system working normally. Having low levels of vitamin D is a common problem that can lead to bone disorders and other medical problems. Vitamin D testing can let you know if you need to increase your vitamin D levels. You get vitamin D in three ways. Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to sunlight. You get vitamin D from certain foods. Only a few foods, such as egg yolks and fatty fish, naturally contain vitamin D. That's why vitamin D is added to foods, including breakfast cereals, milk, and other dairy items. You can take vitamin D supplements.
wbc	WBC	White Blood Cell (WBC) Count (also called leukocytes) is a measurement of your white blood cells, which are part of your immune system. They are a type of blood cell made in your bone marrow and found in your blood and lymph tissue (part of your immune system). If you are injured or get sick, the white blood cells travel through your bloodstream and tissues to where they are needed. There, they help your body fight off infections and other diseases. When you get sick, your body makes more white blood cells to fight the bacteria, viruses, or other foreign substances causing your illness. This increases your white blood count. Some diseases can cause your body to make fewer white blood cells than you need. This lowers your white blood count. Diseases can lower your white blood count include some types of cancer and HIV, a viral disease that attacks white blood cells. Certain medicines, including chemotherapy, also may lower the number of your white blood cells. There are five major types of white blood cells: Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, and Basophils.

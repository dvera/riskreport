crp	adv	C-Reactive Protein (CRP)	1	"C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein your liver makes. Normally, you have low levels of CRP in your blood. Your liver releases more CRP into your bloodstream if you have inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP may mean you have a serious health condition causing inflammation. Inflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues and helping them heal from an injury, infection, or other disease. If inflammation lasts too long, it can damage healthy tissues. This is called chronic (long-term) inflammation. Chronic infections, certain autoimmune disorders, and other diseases can cause harmful chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation also occurs if your tissues are repeatedly injured or irritated, for example from smoking or chemicals in the environment."
cystatin_c	adv	Cystatin C	1	"Cystatin C is protein found in the blood that helps measure kidney function. It is produced at a steady rate by most cells in the body and then filtered out by the kidneys. By measuring how much cystatin C is in the blood, clinicians can estimate how well the kidneys are working. When kidney function is good, cystatin C levels are low because the kidneys filter it out efficiently. High levels can suggest the kidneys are not filtering well, which may indicate kidney disease. Cystatin C is especially useful because it is less affected by factors like muscle mass, potentially making it a more accurate measure of kidney health than other tests, like creatinine."
ggt	adv	Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)	1	"Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found throughout your body, but it is mainly found in your liver. Enzymes are proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body. Thousands of enzymes play an important role in all of your body functions. If your liver or bile duct is damaged, GGT may leak into your bloodstream. High levels of GGT in your blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes carrying bile in and out of the liver. Bile is an important fluid for digestion made by the liver. While GGT can’t diagnose the specific cause of liver disease, levels that are out of range can indicate your liver is being damaged."
shbg	adv	Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)	1	"SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) is a protein made mostly in your liver. It binds (attaches) to sex hormones in your blood. SHBG helps control the amount of sex hormones actively working in your body. When the SHBG protein binds to sex hormones, your tissues can't use those hormones. Your tissues can only use sex hormones that are ""free,"" which means they aren't attached to proteins, such as SHBG. An SHBG test is usually done if you have signs and/or symptoms of having too much or too little of the sex hormone testosterone."
testosterone	adv	Testosterone	1	"Testosterone is known as a ""male"" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. Testosterone is made by the testicles (or testes), the part of the male reproductive system that makes sperm; the ovaries, the part of the female reproductive system that makes eggs; the adrenal glands, organs on top of each kidney that make several hormones."
vitamin_d	adv	Vitamin D Level	1	"Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones and teeth, and for your body to work well. It also helps keep your muscles, nerves, and immune system working normally. Having low levels of vitamin D is a common problem that can lead to bone disorders and other medical problems. Vitamin D testing can let you know if you need to increase your vitamin D levels. You get vitamin D in three ways. Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to sunlight. Only a few foods, such as egg yolks and fatty fish, naturally contain vitamin D. You can take vitamin D supplements."
igf1	adv	IGF1	1	"IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) is a hormone, a chemical messenger in your bloodstream controlling the actions of certain cells or organs. IGF-1 manages the effects of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Together, IGF-1 and GH promote normal growth of bones and tissues. GH levels in the blood change throughout the day, depending on your diet and activity levels, while IGF-1 levels are more stable. A reliable way to track GH in your body is by measuring the level of IGF-1 in the blood. Levels of IGF-1 and GH change throughout your life. Besides growth, GH also helps control your metabolism, which is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Some conditions, such as pituitary tumors, can cause your body to produce too much or too little GH."
Smoke_Pack_Yrs	basic	Smoking History (Pack-Years)	1	"Smoke Pack Years is a measure of smoking exposure calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette packs smoked per day by the number of years the person has smoked. It's a common way to assess the long-term impact of smoking on health, particularly in studies related to lung disease."
bmi	basic	Body Mass Index (BMI)	2	"Body Mass Index (BMI) is quick calculation using a person's height and weight to estimate if they are within a healthy weight range. It does not directly measure body fat but gives an idea of whether someone might be underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese."
body_fat_percentage	basic	Body Fat Percentage	6	"Proportion of body weight that is fat tissue. High body fat increases risk for metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease."
grip_strength	basic	Hand Grip Strength	7	"Grip Strength is a simple measure of how much force you generate when you squeeze with your hand. It is tested by squeezing a device called a dynamometer, which records the strength of your grip. This measurement is not just about hand strength; it is also a quick indicator of overall muscle strength and health. Studies show lower grip strength often is linked to a higher risk of certain health issues, like heart disease or mobility problems, especially in older adults. Tracking grip strength helps clinicians assess muscle health, recovery progress, or the risk of future health conditions."
resting_heartrate	basic	Resting Heart Rate	4	"Pulse Rate (or resting heart rate) measures the number of times your heart beats per minute at rest. It provides information on heart health and can vary with activity, stress, and health conditions. Resting heart rate gives insights into cardiovascular fitness and overall health, with lower rates often indicating better fitness and higher rates suggesting potential stress, dehydration, or heart conditions. Sudden changes also may signal early health issues like infection or thyroid changes."
systolic_blood_pressure	basic	Systolic Blood Pressure	3	"Systolic Blood Pressure is the top number in a blood pressure reading. It indicates the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). A blood pressure measurement is a test measuring the force (pressure) in your arteries as your heart pumps. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers: systolic and diastolic blood pressure."

Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. An RBC count higher or lower than normal is often the first sign of an illness."
rdw	cbc	Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW)	6	"Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in the volume and size of your red blood cells (erythrocytes). Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow (the spongy tissue inside your large bones). They contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. Normally, your red blood cells are about the same size. Differences in the size of your red blood cells may affect how well they can deliver oxygen through your body. An RDW test uses a special graph called a histogram. If your red blood cells are about the same size, they will be close together on the histogram, and the RDW will be low. A high RDW means the size of your red blood cells varies more than it should. The sizes will be more spread out on the histogram. This may be a sign of a medical condition."
wbc	cbc	White Blood Cell Count	1	"White Blood Cell (WBC) Count (also called leukocytes) is a measurement of your white blood cells, which are part of your immune system. They are a type of blood cell made in your bone marrow and found in your blood and lymph tissue (part of your immune system). WBCs help your body fight off infections and other diseases."

Purines also are found in many foods and beverages. Most uric acid dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine. If uric acid builds up in your blood, it can form needle-shaped crystals in and around your joints. This condition is called gout. Gout is a type of arthritis causing painful swelling in your joints. High uric acid levels also can cause kidney stones, or kidney failure. However, not everyone with high levels of uric acid will have these problems."

Glucose attaches to the hemoglobin protein on the red blood cells. The higher the HbA1c percentage, the more glucose attached to the hemoglobin. Elevated HbA1c levels are associated with metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and diabetes. Because it is not as affected by occasional fluctuations in blood glucose, HbA1c can detect diabetes before a fasting blood glucose level can. **Please be aware that HbA1c can be inaccurate for various medical conditions such as if a person is anemic or has factors influencing blood volume."
creatinine	cmp	Creatinine	1	"Creatinine is a normal waste product in your body. It's made when you use your muscles and some of the muscle tissue breaks down. Normally, your kidneys filter creatinine from your blood and remove it from your body in your urine.

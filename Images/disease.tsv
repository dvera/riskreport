mace	Cardiac	Cardiac Health	"For cardiac health we model and predict the 15-year probability of a **Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE).** ÊWe define **MACE** as all myocardial infarctions (or heart attacks), all strokes (hemorrhagic and ischemic) and complications following these events. Below are values of our model's most predictive biomarkers for MACE in males and females aged 55 to 70 with no prior history of MACE."	Below are suggested target values for the most predictive biomarkers for experiencing MACE in males and females aged 55 to 70 with no prior history of MACE.	"LDL and Lipoprotein(a) are included as they commonly are associated with MACE. However, they were not top predictive biomarkers."	The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
diabetes	Metabolic	Metabolic Health	"For metabolic health we model and predict **type 2 diabetes,** a chronic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood. This is a result of the body developing a resistance to insulin, or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. This results in the body's inability to process and use sugar (glucose) properly. High blood sugar increases risk for heart attack, stroke, dementia, kidney disease, vision loss, and infections."	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers for developing type 2 diabetes in males and females aged 40 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
dementia	Cognitive	Cognitive Health	"For cognitive health we model and predict **dementia** which is an age-related condition resulting from accumulated damage to the brain and nerve cells, leading to cognitive and physical decline. ÊThis interferes with memory, mood, and the ability to function independently in daily life."	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers for developing dementia in males and females aged 60 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
renal	Kidney	Kidney Health	"For kidney health we model and predict **acute renal disease**. Acute renal disease results in the loss of kidney function. These functions include filtering the blood and removing waste (detox), regulating fluids, electrolytes and blood pressure, assisting in red blood cell production, and activating vitamin D."	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing acute kidney disease in males and females aged 55 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
liver	Liver	Liver Health	"For liver health we model and predict non-cancerous, non-acute and non-viral associated **liver diseases** resulting in the loss of liver function. Liver functions include filtering harmful substances from the blood (toxins, drugs, alcohol, bacteria), metabolizing and storing energy (protein, carbohydrate, fats), blood clotting, bile production for digestion, storing vitamins and minerals, and producing immune factors."	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing liver disease in males and females aged 40 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
copd	Lung	Lung Health	"For lung health we model and predict **chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**, a class of progressive lung disease resulting in difficulty breathing, and negatively impacts overall health."	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing COPD in males and females aged 50 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.	
mortality	Mortality	All-cause Mortality	**All-cause mortality** refers to death due to any cause. It includes death from the other age-related conditions in this guide but not limited to them. We predict 15-year all-cause mortality in our models.	Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for experiencing death in males and females aged 55 to 70.		The tables below contain disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.

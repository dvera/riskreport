mace	Heart	Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)	A **Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE)** is a heart or blood vessel related event that negatively impacts your health. Examples include heart disease, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, or other adverse coronary outcomes.	Below are suggested target values for the most predictive biomarkers for experiencing MACE in males and females aged 55 to 70 with no prior history of MACE.	LDL and Systolic Blood Pressure are included as they are commonly looked at for MACE. However, they are not top predictive biomarkers.	The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
diabetes	Diabetes	Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)	**Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** occurs when the body develops a resistance to insulin, or your pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. This results in the body being unable to process and use sugar properly.	Below are suggested target values for the most predictive biomarkers for developing Type 2 Diabetes in males and females aged 40 to 70.		The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
dementia	Dementia	Dementia	**Dementia** is an age-related condition resulting from accumulated damage to brain and nerve cells, leading to cognitive and physical decline that interferes with the ability to function in daily life.	Below are suggested target values for the most predictive biomarkers for developing Dementia in males and females aged 60 to 70.		The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
renal	Kidney	Acute Kidney Disease	**Acute Kidney Disease** occurs when the kidneys begin to lose their function.	Below are suggested target values for our model’s most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing acute kidney disease in males and females aged 55 to 70.		The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
liver	Liver	Liver Disease	**Liver Disease** refers to a set of conditions that prevent the proper function of the liver.	Below are suggested target values for our model’s most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing Liver Disease in males and females aged 40 to 70.		The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
copd	Lung	Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease	**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)** is a class of progressive lung diseases that results in difficulty breathing.	Below are suggested target values for our model’s most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing COPD in males and females aged 50 to 70.		The table below contains disease-specific risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.	
mortality	Mortality	All-cause Mortality	**All-Cause Mortality** refers to all forms of death due to any cause. It includes death from the other age-related issues in this guide, but is not limited to them.

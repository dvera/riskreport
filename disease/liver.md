## Liver Health


"For liver health we model and predict non-cancerous, non-acute and non-viral associated **liver diseases** resulting in the loss of liver function. Liver functions include filtering harmful substances from the blood (toxins, drugs, alcohol, bacteria), metabolizing and storing energy (protein, carbohydrate, fats), blood clotting, bile production for digestion, storing vitamins and minerals, and producing immune factors."


Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing liver disease in males and females aged 40 to 70.

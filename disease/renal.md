## Kidney Health


"For kidney health we model and predict **acute renal disease**. Acute renal disease results in the loss of kidney function. These functions include filtering the blood and removing waste (detox), regulating fluids, electrolytes and blood pressure, assisting in red blood cell production, and activating vitamin D."


Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers or inputs for developing acute kidney disease in males and females aged 55 to 70.

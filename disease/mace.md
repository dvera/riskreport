## Cardiac Health


"For cardiac health we model and predict the 15-year probability of a **Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE).** ÊWe define **MACE** as all myocardial infarctions (or heart attacks), all strokes (hemorrhagic and ischemic) and complications following these events. Below are values of our model's most predictive biomarkers for MACE in males and females aged 55 to 70 with no prior history of MACE."


Below are suggested target values for the most predictive biomarkers for experiencing MACE in males and females aged 55 to 70 with no prior history of MACE.

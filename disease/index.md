# VMRs by Disease

This section provides VMRs for each of the most predictive biomarkers for measuring the likelihood of getting a disease. These are provided as a reference for patients to compare their blood test results to. The data apply to clinically relevant age ranges for each disease.

At present, the seven (7) common age-related diseases explored in this report are All-Cause Mortality, Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE), Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Dementia, Kidney/Renal Disease, Liver Disease, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), given their prevalence and individual impacts on aging and mortality. The table below can be used to link to a specific disease.

- [Dementia](/disease/dementia/)
- [Renal Disease](/disease/renal/)
- [Liver Disease](/disease/liver/)
- [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)](/disease/copd/)
- [All-Cause Mortality](/disease/mortality/)


## Reading this Section

This section provides a two-page report for each of the seven (7) diseases listed above. The first page will include a description and a table below including the strength values for the most predictive biomarkers for that disease, as well as the VMR for that biomarker.

**VMRs in this section are overall ranges, rather than for a specific disease.** The second page includes risk ratios for each of the included biomarkers.

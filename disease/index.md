# Most Predictive Biomarkers by Disease

This section provides VMR values for our models' most predictive biomarkers in each of the seven categories listed below. The VMR values apply to clinically relevant age ranges for each disease. You can use them as a reference to compare your own blood test results, but it is imperative to review all interpretation and treatment decisions with your physician.

- [Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE)](/disease//mace/)
- [Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)](/disease/diabetes/)
- [Dementia](/disease/dementia/)
- [Renal Disease](/disease/renal/)
- [Liver Disease](/disease/liver/)
- [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)](/disease/copd/)

## About this Section

This section provides two parts. The first part includes a description of the disease category and a table portraying the strength values for our model's most predictive biomarkers for that disease, as well as the VMR for each biomarker. Note that VMR in this section are overall ranges, rather than values for a specific disease.

The second part of each disease page includes disease-specific risk multipliers for each of the included biomarkers.

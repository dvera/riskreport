## Metabolic Health


"For metabolic health we model and predict **type 2 diabetes,** a chronic disease characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood. This is a result of the body developing a resistance to insulin, or the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. This results in the body's inability to process and use sugar (glucose) properly. High blood sugar increases risk for heart attack, stroke, dementia, kidney disease, vision loss, and infections."


Below are values for our model's most predictive biomarkers for developing type 2 diabetes in males and females aged 40 to 70.

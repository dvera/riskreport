## Hemoglobin


Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. Your hemoglobin levels provide information about the health of your red blood cells. If your hemoglobin levels are abnormal, it may be a sign that you have a blood disorder, often referred to as anemia.

## LDL


LDL Cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein), or "bad" cholesterol, is one of two types of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood and every cell of your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Too much LDL cholesterol in your blood increases your risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases. High LDL levels cause the buildup of a sticky substance called plaque in your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. Over time, plaque narrows your arteries or fully blocks them. When this happens, parts of your body may not get enough blood. If the blood flow to your heart is blocked, it can cause a heart attack. If the blood flow to your brain is blocked, it can cause a stroke. If the blood flow to your arms or legs is blocked, it can cause peripheral artery disease.

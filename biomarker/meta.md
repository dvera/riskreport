## Metabolites


Metabolites, as measured through NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) metabolomics, represent a detailed profile of small molecules in the blood that reflect dynamic physiological processes. This category includes a wide range of biomarkers such as amino acids, lipoprotein subclasses, fatty acids, and glycolysis-related compounds that offer insight into energy balance, metabolic efficiency, and systemic health. Unlike traditional panels, NMR-based metabolomics enables high-resolution quantification of these molecules, providing a more nuanced view of cardiometabolic risk, inflammation, and metabolic flexibility. These advanced profiles are increasingly used in research and precision health to detect early pathophysiological changes and personalize interventions.

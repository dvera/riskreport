## Lipid Panel


A lipid panel is a standard blood test used to assess cardiovascular risk by measuring the levels of key blood lipids. It typically includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol (often labeled “bad” cholesterol), HDL cholesterol (“good” cholesterol), and triglycerides. These markers help evaluate how the body processes fats and can indicate risk for atherosclerosis, heart attack, and stroke. The lipid panel is a foundational tool in both routine screenings and the management of conditions like hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome. It is often used to guide lifestyle changes and pharmacologic interventions aimed at improving heart health.

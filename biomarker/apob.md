## Apolipoprotein B (ApoB)


"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the main protein found in atherogenic lipoproteins like LDL and VLDL, with each particle carrying one apoB molecule. Because of this, apoB levels reflect the total number of these cholesterol-carrying particles in the blood and are considered a more accurate indicator of cardiovascular risk than traditional LDL-C measurements."

## Triglycerides


Triglycerides is the amount of a fat in your blood called triglycerides. High triglycerides may increase your risk for a heart attack or stroke. Your body uses triglycerides for energy. If you eat more calories than you need, your body turns the extra calories into triglycerides and stores them in your fat cells to use later. When your body needs energy, your cells release triglycerides into your bloodstream to provide fuel for your muscles to work. If you eat more calories than you burn off, especially calories from carbohydrates, including sugary foods, and fats, you may have high triglyceride levels in your blood. A high blood triglyceride level usually doesn't cause any acute symptoms, but over time, may affect your arteries and pancreas and increase your risk of heart disease and pancreatitis.

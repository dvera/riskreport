## Testosterone


"Testosterone is known as a ""male"" sex hormone, but females have testosterone in smaller amounts. Testosterone is made by the testicles (or testes), the part of the male reproductive system that makes sperm; the ovaries, the part of the female reproductive system that makes eggs; the adrenal glands, organs on top of each kidney that make several hormones."

# Risk Ratios by Biomarker

Depending on your health goals, it can be more helpful to view risk ratios by each biomarker. The first table below shows each of the biomarkers included and links you to the associated table of values.

## Reading this Section

This section provides ranges for the select biomarkers shown above. The % column shows the prevalence in that range from the UK Biobank for ages 40-70, and the following columns show the associated risk ratios for each disease. The VMRs for males and females for each biomarker are shown above the tables as well.

## AST


Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme found mostly in the liver, but it is also found in muscles and other organs in your body. When cells containing AST are damaged, they release the AST into your blood. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test is commonly used to help diagnose liver damage or disease.

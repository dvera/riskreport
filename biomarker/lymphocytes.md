## Lymphocyte Count


Lymphocyte Count is part of a complete blood count (CBC) and measures lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell important for immune response. It can be elevated by infections or immune conditions and lowered by certain diseases or treatments. A CBC is a group of blood tests measuring the number and size of the different cells in your blood.

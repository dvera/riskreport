## Nutraceuticals


Nutraceuticals encompass dietary supplements and functional foods that individuals consume to support or enhance health beyond basic nutritional needs. This category includes vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds—such as fish oil, garlic, glucosamine, and evening primrose oil—as well as multivitamins and targeted supplements like folic acid, zinc, and vitamin D. These self-administered interventions are often used for their potential roles in immune support, joint health, cardiovascular protection, and overall well-being. Tracking nutraceutical intake provides valuable context when interpreting clinical and biochemical data, especially in personalized health approaches where supplementation may influence biomarker levels or disease risk.

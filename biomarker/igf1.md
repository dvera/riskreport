## IGF1


IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) is a hormone, a chemical messenger in your bloodstream controlling the actions of certain cells or organs. IGF-1 manages the effects of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Together, IGF-1 and GH promote normal growth of bones and tissues. GH levels in the blood change throughout the day, depending on your diet and activity levels, while IGF-1 levels are more stable. A reliable way to track GH in your body is by measuring the level of IGF-1 in the blood. Levels of IGF-1 and GH change throughout your life. They are normally low when you are a child, increase until they peak during puberty, then decrease once you are an adult. Besides growth, GH also helps control your metabolism, which is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Some conditions, such as pituitary tumors, can cause your body to make too much or too little GH.

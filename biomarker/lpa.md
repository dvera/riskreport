## Lipoprotein a


Lipoprotein (a) is a type of LDL (low-density lipoprotein) or "bad" cholesterol. Lipoproteins are particles made of protein and fats (lipids). They carry cholesterol through your bloodstream to your cells. These lipoproteins carry cholesterol to the cells in your arteries. If you have high levels of LDL particles, cholesterol can build up in your arteries and form blockages called plaques. This condition is known as atherosclerosis or "hardening of the arteries." It can lead many serious medical conditions including coronary artery disease (narrow or blocked arteries in your heart), heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease (blocked arteries in your legs or arms), or other blood vessel diseases. Lipoprotein (a) particles are stickier than other types of LDL particles, so they may be more likely to cause blockages and blood clots in your arteries. As a result, high levels of lipoprotein (a) may mean you have a very high risk for heart disease, stroke, and other serious conditions related to blockages and blood clots in your arteries. A lipoprotein (a) blood test gives you a more accurate understanding of your risk than a routine cholesterol tests only measuring your total LDL cholesterol level. This is because a routine cholesterol test may show your LDL cholesterol level is "healthy," but if a large percentage of your LDL cholesterol is carried by lipoprotein (a) particles, your risk for heart disease and stroke could still be high.

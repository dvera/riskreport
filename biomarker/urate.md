## Uric Acid (Urate)


"Urate (also known as Uric Acid) is a normal waste product your body makes when it breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines come from your cells when they die. Purines also are found in many foods and beverages. Most uric acid dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine. If uric acid builds up in your blood, it can form needle-shaped crystals in and around your joints. This condition is called gout. Gout is a type of arthritis causing painful swelling in your joints. High uric acid levels also can cause kidney stones, or kidney failure. However, not everyone with high levels of uric acid will have these problems."

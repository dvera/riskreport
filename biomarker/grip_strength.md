## Grip Strength


Grip Strength is a simple measure of how much force you generate when you squeeze with your hand. It’s tested by squeezing a device called a dynamometer, which records the strength of your grip. This measurement isn’t just about hand strength; it’s also a quick indicator of overall muscle strength and health. Studies show lower grip strength often is linked to a higher risk of certain health issues, like heart disease or mobility problems, especially in older adults. Tracking grip strength helps clinicians assess muscle health, recovery progress, or the risk of future health conditions.

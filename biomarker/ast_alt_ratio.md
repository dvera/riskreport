## AST/ALT Ratio


AST-ALT Ratio is a simple comparison of two liver enzymes, AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase), measured in the blood to help assess liver health. In healthy livers, ALT levels are generally higher than AST because ALT is more specific to the liver. When liver damage occurs, both AST and ALT can rise, but the ratio between them can hint at the type or severity of liver issues. For example, an AST level thatâ€™s much higher than ALT (usually a ratio over two) sometimes indicates alcoholic liver disease. A ratio closer to one or below may suggest other liver conditions, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

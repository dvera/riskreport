## Albumin


Albumin is a protein produced by the liver that plays an important role in maintaining blood volume and transporting various substances, including hormones, vitamins, and medications. Monitoring albumin levels helps diagnose and manage conditions related to the liver, kidneys, and nutritional status. Low albumin levels can indicate liver disease, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis, as the liver is responsible for producing this protein. Abnormal albumin levels can also be a sign of kidney disease, malnutrition, or inflammation, as the bodyâ€™s ability to produce or retain albumin is affected by these conditions.

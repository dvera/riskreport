## Smoking History (Pack-Years)


"Smoke Pack Years is a measure of smoking exposure calculated by multiplying the number of cigarette packs smoked per day by the number of years the person has smoked. It's a common way to assess the long-term impact of smoking on health, particularly in studies related to lung disease."

## HDL


HDL Cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein) is often called the "good" cholesterol because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from the bloodstream. HDL transports excess cholesterol (a waxy, fat-like substance found in your blood) from the arteries back to the liver, where it is processed and eliminated from the body, reducing the risk of cholesterol buildup which can lead to heart disease or stroke. The ideal HDL levels vary by age and gender.

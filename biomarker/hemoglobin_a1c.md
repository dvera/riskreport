## HbA1C


Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) reflects your average blood sugar (glucose) level over the past two to three months. Glucose is a type of sugar in your blood that comes from the foods you eat. Your cells use glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin balances glucose in your blood and cells. Glucose in your blood sticks to hemoglobin, a protein in your red blood cells. As your blood glucose levels increase, more of your hemoglobin will be coated with glucose. An A1C test measures the percentage of your red blood cells reflecting glucose-coated hemoglobin. High A1C levels are a sign of high blood glucose from diabetes.

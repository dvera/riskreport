## Physical/Vitals


Physical measures and vitals represent a foundational category of health metrics that directly reflect an individual’s physiological state and lifestyle impact. These indicators—such as BMI, body fat percentage, waist circumference, and smoke pack years—offer insight into metabolic health and long-term disease risk. Functional assessments like grip strength and resting heart rate help quantify cardiovascular fitness and muscular integrity, while blood pressure serves as a critical marker of circulatory system status. Together, these metrics are often used in clinical, fitness, and preventative health contexts to monitor health status, guide interventions, and stratify risk.

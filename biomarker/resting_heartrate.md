## Pulse Rate


Pulse Rate (or resting heart rate) measures the number of times your heart beats per minute at rest. It provides information on heart health and can vary with activity, stress, and health conditions. Resting heart rate gives insights into cardiovascular fitness and overall health, with lower rates often indicating better fitness and higher rates suggesting potential stress, dehydration, or heart conditions. Sudden changes also may signal early health issues like infection or thyroid changes.

## Vitamin D


Vitamin D is essential for healthy bones and teeth, and for your body to work well. It also helps keep your muscles, nerves, and immune system working normally. Having low levels of vitamin D is a common problem that can lead to bone disorders and other medical problems. Vitamin D testing can let you know if you need to increase your vitamin D levels. You get vitamin D in three ways. Your body makes vitamin D when your bare skin is exposed to sunlight. You get vitamin D from certain foods. Only a few foods, such as egg yolks and fatty fish, naturally contain vitamin D. That's why vitamin D is added to foods, including breakfast cereals, milk, and other dairy items. You can take vitamin D supplements.

## Lymphocyte %


The lymphocyte percent test, part of a Complete Blood Count (CBC), measures the proportion of lymphocytes among white blood cells, providing insight into immune system health. High lymphocyte percentages can indicate viral infections, chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, or certain cancers, while low percentages may suggest acute infections, immunodeficiencies, autoimmune diseases, or bone marrow disorders. This test helps diagnose and monitor conditions related to immune function and inflammation.

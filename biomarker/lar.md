## LDL/ApoB Ratio


LDL-ApoB Ratio (LAR) compares levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) with Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), the main protein in LDL particles. This ratio provides additional information on cardiovascular risk by assessing both the cholesterol content and the number of LDL particles, as each ApoB represents an LDL particle. A lower LAR may indicate smaller, denser LDL particles, which are associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.

## Complete Blood Counts


A Complete Blood Count (CBC) panel is a standard clinical test that measures various components of the blood to assess overall health and detect a wide range of disorders. It includes key metrics such as red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count, among others. These values help evaluate oxygen-carrying capacity, immune function, and clotting ability. The CBC is commonly used for diagnosing infections, anemia, inflammation, and hematologic conditions, and it serves as a routine part of health screenings and ongoing medical evaluations.

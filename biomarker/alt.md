## Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)


"Alanine Transaminase (ALT) is an enzyme found mostly in the liver. An ALT test measures the amount of ALT in the blood. When liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream. High levels of ALT in your blood may be a sign of a liver injury or disease. Some types of liver disease cause high ALT levels before you have symptoms of the disease. Thus, ALT blood tests may help diagnose certain liver diseases early."

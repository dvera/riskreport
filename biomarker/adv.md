## Advanced Biomarkers


Advanced biomarkers refer to a category of blood-based indicators that extend beyond routine clinical panels and offer deeper insights into metabolic, hormonal, inflammatory, and cardiovascular health. These markers—such as CRP (inflammation), cystatin C (kidney function), SHBG and testosterone (hormonal status), Lp(a) and GGT (cardiometabolic risk), and vitamin D (bone and immune health)—are not typically included in standard screenings like a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or basic lipid panel. They are often used in preventative, functional, or precision medicine contexts to identify subclinical dysfunctions or assess long-term disease risk. Their inclusion in testing strategies is growing as research supports their value in predicting outcomes and guiding early interventions.

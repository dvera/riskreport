## Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)


"Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT) is an enzyme found throughout your body, but it is mainly found in your liver. Enzymes are proteins that speed up certain chemical reactions in your body. Thousands of enzymes play an important role in all of your body functions. If your liver or bile duct is damaged, GGT may leak into your bloodstream. High levels of GGT in your blood may be a sign of liver disease or damage to the bile ducts. Bile ducts are tubes carrying bile in and out of the liver. Bile is an important fluid for digestion made by the liver. While GGT can’t diagnose the specific cause of liver disease, levels that are out of range can indicate your liver is being damaged."

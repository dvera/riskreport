## Glucose


Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It originates from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or cannot use insulin as well as it should, or both. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems and diabetes complications.

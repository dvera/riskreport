## Red Blood Cell Count


"Red Blood Cell Count (RBC) measures the number of red blood cells, also known as erythrocytes, in your blood. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue inside your large bones. They contain hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that carries oxygen from your lungs to every cell in your body. Your cells need oxygen to grow, reproduce, and make energy for you to function. An RBC count higher or lower than normal is often the first sign of an illness."

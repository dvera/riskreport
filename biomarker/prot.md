## Proteins


Proteins, as measured by Olinkâ€™s platform, are quantified using proximity extension assays and reported in Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) units, a relative measure that allows for high-throughput, multiplexed protein analysis. This category includes a wide array of circulating proteins involved in inflammation, cardiovascular function, neurology, oncology, and metabolic regulation. The NPX values reflect relative abundance within a study cohort rather than absolute concentrations, making them useful for identifying patterns and associations with disease risk across populations. These measurements are powerful for research and exploratory applications, helping to uncover protein-disease relationships, but are not intended for direct clinical interpretation or individualized assessment.

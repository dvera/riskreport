## C-Reactive Protein (CRP)


"C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a protein your liver makes. Normally, you have low levels of CRP in your blood. Your liver releases more CRP into your bloodstream if you have inflammation in your body. High levels of CRP may mean you have a serious health condition causing inflammation. Inflammation is your body's way of protecting your tissues and helping them heal from an injury, infection, or other disease. If inflammation lasts too long, it can damage healthy tissues. This is called chronic (long-term) inflammation. Chronic infections, certain autoimmune disorders, and other diseases can cause harmful chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation also occurs if your tissues are repeatedly injured or irritated, for example from smoking or chemicals in the environment."

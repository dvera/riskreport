## Eosinophil Count


Eosinophil Count is a type of white blood cell helping the body fight off infections and react to allergens. Eosinophils are part of the immune system and usually make up a small percentage of the total white blood cells. A higher-than-normal eosinophil count can indicate an allergic reaction, asthma, or a parasitic infection. It also can signal certain inflammatory conditions or autoimmune diseases. A low count is usually normal and not a cause for concern. By checking eosinophil levels, clinicians gain insight into immune activity and better understand symptoms related to allergies or inflammation.

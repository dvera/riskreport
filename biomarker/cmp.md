## Comprehensive Metabolic Panel


A Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) is a commonly ordered blood test that provides a broad assessment of metabolic and organ function. It includes measurements of glucose, electrolytes (like sodium, potassium, and calcium), kidney markers (such as creatinine and BUN), and liver enzymes (such as ALT, AST, and ALP), as well as total protein and albumin levels. The CMP helps evaluate blood sugar regulation, electrolyte and fluid balance, and the health of the kidneys and liver. It is frequently used in routine checkups and to monitor conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and liver or kidney disease.

## Lifestyle


Lifestyle variables encompass self-reported behaviors related to diet and substance use that can significantly influence long-term health outcomes. This category includes specific dietary habits—such as intake of red meat, poultry, cheese, salt, and water—as well as patterns of alcohol consumption, including beer, wine, and spirits. These variables provide contextual insight into nutritional quality, hydration status, and potential exposures that may affect metabolic, cardiovascular, and overall health. While often overlooked in clinical settings, they are increasingly valued in personalized and preventive health approaches for their role in shaping disease risk and guiding lifestyle interventions.

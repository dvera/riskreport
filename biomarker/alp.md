## ALP


Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in many parts of your body. Monitoring this biomarker helps diagnose diseases of the liver or bones and measure how well your liver is working. Each part of your body produces a different type of ALP. Most ALP is found in your liver, bones, kidneys, and digestive system. Abnormal levels of ALP in your blood may be a sign of a wide range of health conditions, including liver disease, bone disorders, and chronic kidney disease.

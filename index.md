# The Voloridge Health Risk Report

## Introduction

Blood test results can be overwhelming. You’re often presented with too much information, yet not enough at the same time. We want to provide information to help the public better understand bloodwork and health. By the end of this report, you should feel confident in not only determining what to focus on when reading through your blood test results, but also in relating it to your overall health.

## Purpose

This report is designed to serve as a reference when reviewing your blood test results. It contains ranges of values for each biomarker and different age-related diseases useful when checking your personal results.

## What is a biomarker?

The first step to understanding your bloodwork is recognizing what a blood test is collecting and measuring.

A **biomarker** is a measurement of different substances in the blood or other body fluids indicating normal or abnormal processes or conditions in your body.<sup>[\[1\]](#footnote-2)</sup> This takes many forms. One of the most common ways to directly measure certain biomarkers is through blood tests, if the biomarker is present in your blood. For example, LDL cholesterol is a type of fat and is measured in your blood.

Biomarkers are the key to understanding your health and early detection of disease. A simple blood test gives you information about your risk for heart disease, liver disease, mortality, and more.<sup>[\[2\]](#footnote-3)</sup>

Determining if your blood test results are good for a given biomarker is challenging. In this report, we present the information in the form of a risk ratio.

## What is a risk ratio?

A **risk ratio** is a statistic used to show how high your risk is for a specific disease relative to other people your age and gender. A risk ratio of one (1) means your risk is exactly average for your age. A risk ratio from zero (0) to one (1) means your risk is lower than the average for your age. This suggests you are doing better than your peers. If your risk ratio is higher than one (1), you have an elevated risk for the disease.

While risk ratios are great for understanding how you compare to others your age, it can be misleading if the risk for your age group is very high. For example, you may be looking at the average risk for heart disease for people aged 60-70. If you are 63 years old and see a risk ratio of 0.73, you might be happy to know you are at a reduced risk! However, even if your risk ratio is below 1, this does not equate to your risk level being healthy or ideal. To help with this challenge, we also provide a set of values called the **Voloridge Model (“VM”) Range**. This range is a set of values our models considered healthy for a biomarker. This is what you and your physician can aim for, depending on your health goals.

## What can I do about it?

Understanding bloodwork is vital for understanding your overall health. However, it’s important to maintain sight of what is most important: feeling great and staying healthy. Depending on your age and lifestyle, different types of diseases may be more important to focus. While intervention effects on biomarkers are not always direct, biomarkers can be used as metrics to assess lifestyle and overall health. If you find that a specific blood test result is particularly concerning, do research and consult your doctor for help.

## Values in this Report: VMRs and Predictive Strength

The values in this report are all modeled and calculated directly by Voloridge Health and VoLo Foundation. As such, they may differ from those you see on a blood test or online.

While reference ranges provided by blood test results directly can be convenient to use, like risk ratios, they reflect the population’s trends, rather than what is considered healthy. In contrast, Voloridge Health instead determines VMRs based on predictive models. This is what has been provided in this reference guide, and what you and your physician can choose to aim for, depending on your health goals.

Another value used by Voloridge Health when looking at biomarkers as predictors for health is the **predictive** **strength** value. This metric is used to show how correlated the biomarker is with a certain disease risk. In the [VMRs by Disease](#_Our_Findings:_Reference) section, the biomarkers are colored with a gradient like in the graphic below. White represents a Lower strength number, whereas green reprents a higher strength.

You can read more in depth about how VMRs and strength values are calculated in the [Methodology](#_Methodology_1) section. **Please note that findings from Voloridge Health’s analysis of UK Biobank data should be interpreted with caution due to the dataset’s demographic limitations and potential biases.**
